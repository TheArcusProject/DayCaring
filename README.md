# DayCaring

DayCaring is a search tool for parents looking for the best match Day Care or Preschool for their child.

DayCaring has a comprehensive list of all Day Cares and Preschools in the state of Texas.  We pull registration and compliance data for all schools from data.Texas.gov.  In addition, representatives of the schools may add their own information about the school, and users can submit reviews about the school.
