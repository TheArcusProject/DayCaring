# DayCaring

DayCaring is an app designed for parents and daycare owners to locate and connect with one another. Parents can search for all nearby daycares in their area and receive honest in-depth information for each daycare, as well as ratings, reviews and violations. Daycare owners can respond to customer feedback to further enhance their daycare, as well as provide images and other useful info to parents.

DayCaring has a comprehensive list of all Day Cares and Preschools in the state of Texas.  We pull registration and compliance data for all schools from data.Texas.gov.
